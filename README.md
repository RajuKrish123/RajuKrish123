Set Up OAuth Access for Gmail and Outlook:

Set up OAuth access to Gmail and Outlook.
Use Google API for Gmail OAuth and Microsoft Graph API for Outlook OAuth.
Implement the OAuth flow for both email providers to allow users to authenticate and authorize the application.
Email Fetching and Parsing:

Use the authorized tokens to fetch emails from Gmail and Outlook.
Implement functions to parse the email content and metadata (sender, subject, body).
Context Understanding and Label Assignment:

Integrate OpenAI's API to analyze the email content.
Based on the analysis, assign one of the following labels: Interested, Not Interested, More Information.
Automated Email Replies:

Create response templates for each label.
Use OpenAI's API to generate context-specific replies.
Implement a function to send replies using Gmail and Outlook APIs.
Task Scheduling with BullMQ:

Set up BullMQ for task scheduling and queue management.
Schedule tasks for checking new emails, analyzing content, and sending replies.
Automated Demo Script:

Implement a script to demonstrate the tool's functionality automatically.
Ensure it showcases connecting new email accounts, reading emails, categorizing them, and sending replies.
Steps to Implement
1. Set Up OAuth Access
Gmail OAuth Setup:

Register your application in the Google Cloud Console.
Enable the Gmail API.
Set up OAuth consent screen and credentials.
Implement OAuth flow using a library like google-auth-library in TypeScript.
Outlook OAuth Setup:

Register your application in the Azure Portal.
Enable Microsoft Graph API.
Set up OAuth consent and credentials.
Implement OAuth flow using @azure/msal-node library in TypeScript.
2. Fetch and Parse Emails
Gmail:

Use Gmail API to fetch emails.
Parse the emails using the googleapis library.
Outlook:

Use Microsoft Graph API to fetch emails.
Parse the emails using @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client library.
3. Analyze Emails and Assign Labels
Integrate OpenAI's GPT model to analyze email content.
Create functions to classify emails into "Interested", "Not Interested", and "More Information" based on the content.
4. Generate and Send Replies
Create response templates.
Use OpenAI's API to generate detailed replies based on email context.
Send replies using Gmail and Outlook APIs.
5. Implement Task Scheduling with BullMQ
Set up BullMQ in your TypeScript project.
Create job queues for checking emails, analyzing content, and sending replies.
Schedule jobs to run at specific intervals or based on certain triggers.
Code Snippets and Examples
Gmail OAuth Setup Example
typescript
Copy code
import { google } from 'googleapis';

const oauth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2(
  YOUR_CLIENT_ID,
  YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET,
  YOUR_REDIRECT_URL
);

// Generate an OAuth URL for user authorization
const authUrl = oauth2Client.generateAuthUrl({
  access_type: 'offline',
  scope: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send'],
});

// Exchange code for tokens
const { tokens } = await oauth2Client.getToken(code);
oauth2Client.setCredentials(tokens);
Fetch Emails from Gmail
typescript
Copy code
const gmail = google.gmail({ version: 'v1', auth: oauth2Client });

const res = await gmail.users.messages.list({
  userId: 'me',
  q: 'is:unread'
});

const messages = res.data.messages || [];
for (const message of messages) {
  const msg = await gmail.users.messages.get({
    userId: 'me',
    id: message.id,
  });
  console.log(msg.data.snippet);
}
BullMQ Job Example
typescript
Copy code
import { Queue, Worker } from 'bullmq';

const emailQueue = new Queue('emailQueue');

emailQueue.add('checkEmails', {});

const worker = new Worker('emailQueue', async job => {
  if (job.name === 'checkEmails') {
    // Fetch and process emails
  }
});
Submission Instructions
Screen Recording:

Create a screen recording showcasing all functionalities using a tool like Loom.
Ensure to show the OAuth flow, email fetching, parsing, categorization, and automated replies.
Git Repository:

Create a new Git repository.
Commit your code regularly with clear messages.
Push your code to the repository.
README.md:

Include clear instructions on setting up and running the project locally.
Add any additional information or explanations about implementation choices.
By following these steps and guidelines, you'll be able to create a robust tool for parsing and responding to emails with AI, scheduled by BullMQ and built with TypeScript.
